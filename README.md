## 🧬 Sepsis Disease Prediction

This project focuses on predicting Sepsis in patients using Machine Learning techniques applied on clinical datasets collected from multiple hospitals. The goal is to build a predictive model that can identify whether a patient is likely to develop Sepsis based on physiological and laboratory measurements.

### 🧠 Project Overview

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes tissue damage, organ failure, or death. Early detection and intervention can drastically improve patient outcomes.
In this project, multiple hospital datasets are used to build and compare various machine learning models that predict Sepsis based on patient data.
