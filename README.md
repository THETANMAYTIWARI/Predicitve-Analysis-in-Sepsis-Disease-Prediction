## 🧬 Sepsis Disease Prediction

This project focuses on predicting Sepsis in patients using Machine Learning techniques applied on clinical datasets collected from multiple hospitals. The goal is to build a predictive model that can identify whether a patient is likely to develop Sepsis based on physiological and laboratory measurements.
